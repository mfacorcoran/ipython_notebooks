Fortunately, we can simplify things enormously and only introduce a small error in the calculation of $\\mu$  by assuming that all of the material in a star is fully ionised. This is a valid assumption because hydrogen and helium are very much more abundant than all of the other elements and they are certainly fully ionised in stellar interiors.
