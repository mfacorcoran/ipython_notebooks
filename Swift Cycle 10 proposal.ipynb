      "Eta Car is the nearest supermassive star, a notoriously eruptive variable and arguably the progenitor of the next Galactic SN.  Its periodic 2024-day X-ray emission identifies the star as a massive, long-period, extremely eccentric ($e\\sim0.9$) colliding wind binary in which variable $2-10$ keV X-ray emission is produced by the strong collision of the wind from the companion star (\\ec-B) with that of the Luminous Blue Variable primary (\\ec-A). Detailed monitoring of the variation in the  $2-10$ keV band \n",

Along with strictly cyclical variability, X-ray observations over the last 17 years (3 orbital cycles) have shown surpising variations -- most notably a dramatic shortening of the X-ray ``eclipse'' in 2009 -- which suggest a sudden, large scale change in the mass loss rate or other property of the stellar wind.  We request monitoring observations with the \\swift-XRT to provide critical measurements of the current state of the system up to, through, and after the next X-ray minimum/periastron passage, which occurs in the summer of 2014. \n",

      "Understanding the evolution of extremely massive stars ($M>60$~\\ms) requires a detailed understanding of the evolving way these stars lose mass and angular momentum.   In  the most massive stars, mass loss is difficult to constrain using free-free radio emission, UV P-Cygni absorption features or other conventional diagnostics due to wind clumping, non-spherical mass loss, and eruptions.  For extremely massive stars, short, super-Eddington outbursts (like the ``Great Eruption'' which \\ec\\ suffered in the mid-19th century) may play a dominant role in removing the H-rich envelope.  Such eruptions can eject enormous amounts of mass ($\\gtrsim10$\\ms) into the ISM and rival a supernova in energy. \n",
      "There's recent evidence that eruptive mass loss, perhaps similar to \\ec's ``Great Eruption'', occurs a few years before some fraction of core-collapse SNe; a recent supernova ``imposter'', SN 2009ip, is apparently an example of a star that underwent core collapse just 3 years after its own ``Great Eruption'' in 2009 (Mauerhan et al. 2013).  It is currently unclear whether these eruptive events or  more stable radiatively driven winds determine the final mass of the star.  This leads to substantial uncertainty in understanding how these extremely massive stars evolve from the main sequence to supernovae, neutron star, magnetar, blackhole or GRB-hypernovae.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Eta Car is the nearest, best example we have of a supermassive star ($M_{initial}>100M_{\\odot}$, Hillier et al. 2001), \n",
      "one which suffered a violent ejection of $>10M_{\\odot}$ (whose remnants are still visible as the bipolar Homunculus nebula which surrounds and obscures the star) and which is still losing mass at a prodigious rate ($\\dot{M}\\approx10^{-3}M_\\odot$~yr$^{-1}$). Eta Car presents the unique opportunity to study, in near real-time, the evolution of mass loss in a supermassive star.  Shrouded as it is by the thick Homunculus nebula, direct studies of the star are unfortunately difficult and for more than 100 years the nature of the star (and, in fact, whether the star itself still existed) was a matter of debate. \n",
      "\n",
      "Important progress in understanding \\ec\\ came about in the 1990's with the discovery of a strict 2024-day periodicity at nearly all wavebands (see Damineli et al. 2008 and references therein), including the X-ray band.  The X-ray variability, impressively defined by detailed monitoring over 3 cycles (16 years) with \\rxte, and focussed observations by \\rosat, \\chandra, \\xmm, and \\swift, are the most direct indication that the star is a massive, long-period, extremely eccentric ($e\\sim0.9$) binary system in which the superluminous, massive LBV primary (\\ec-A) is orbited by a bright, massive (but not otherwise directly seen) O-type star, \\ec-B. Eta Car's variable $2-10$ keV X-ray emission is produced by the strong collision of the thin, fast wind from \\ec-B\\  and the massive, slow wind of \\ec-A. The phase-locked X-ray variability provides our most direct constraints on the orbital parameters (and hence as direct a measure of the the mass ratio as we can get), the momentum ratio of the two winds, and on the shape of the wind-wind ``bow shock''. The size and shape of the ``bow shock'' is critical information, because this bow shock produces a cavity in the LBV wind which in turn allows ionizing radiation to escape and illuminate the circumstellar nebulosity like a lighthouse beacon.  This produces optical and UV line variations, correlated with the X-ray lightcurve (but time-delayed) which are used to reconstruct the history of the mass loss process and the 3-D orientation of the system (Teodoro et al. 2013, Madura et al. 2012, 2013).\n",
      "\n",
      "%Studies of the Eta Car binary system allow us to address the following outstanding issues in stellar astrophysics in the upper HRD: what drives the large outbursts?  Do such outbursts dominate the mass loss from the star over the star's evolution?  what evolutionary role does binarity play?  How do strong gravitational and radiative interactions at periastron drive changes in the system? \n",
      "\n",
      "%X-ray observations play a key role in answering these question because\n",
      "%changes in the 2--10 keV X-ray spectrum provide the most easily understandable diagnostics of the wind-driven mass loss for both the LBV primary and the (otherwise unseen) companion star.  Detailed monitoring of the variable X-ray spectrum with \\rxte, along with snapshot observations by \\rosat, \\chandra, \\xmm, and \\swift, have helped constrain the shape of the wind-wind ``bow shock'' and the ratio of the wind momentum flux. This is critical information since this bow shock produces a cavity in the LBV wind which in turn alters the photoionization of the circumstellar nebula and which produces variations correlated with the X-ray lightcurve in nearly all other energy bands.  \n",
      "\n",
      "But the variations are not completely phase-locked and important changes from cycle-to-cycle have been seen. Most notably, the X-ray minimum in 2009 was about 1 month shorter than the other two minima observed with \\rxte\\ (in 2003 and 1998, see Figs. \\ref{fig:lc} \\& \\ref{fig:ao10_interval}, Pian et al. 2009, Corcoran et al. 2010). These non-phase-locked variations are probably related to variations in the mass loss rate of \\ec-A, and most likely signal an important, though not yet fully understood, ongoing change in the LBV primary. \n"

      "Monitoring of the X-ray spectrum up to, during and through the next X-ray minimum/periastron passage in 2014 is crucial for comparison with earlier observations and to constrain what changed in the system. Since the spectrum varies on day-week timescales, X-ray monitoring of the system on these timescales is the only way to fully measure the state of the wind-wind shock during this critical time. This monitoring can only be done with the \\swift-XRT. We propose here to monitor the X-ray spectrum of \\ec\\ with the \\swift-XRT through Cycle 10, which encompasses all the important phases of the next X-ray minimum/periastron passage (Fig \\ref{fig:ao10_interval}): the X-ray brightening/flaring phase at the start of cycle 10, the start of the ``deep minimum'' and ``deep'' to ``shallow'' minimum transition (Hamaguchi 2007, 2013), the X-ray recovery, and the ``breakout'' when the shock breaks free of the LBV wind. Monitoring the X-ray spectrum with \\swift\\ is the only way to determine the timings of these events, and to correlate these events with approved ground- and space-based photometry and spectroscopy observing campaigns which are ongoing, and to measure the current state of the systemic mass loss.   \n",
      "\n",
      "%During Cycle 10 the X-ray spectrum will brighten and harden as the stars approach periastron, then fade due to a combination of wind occultation and rapid cooling in the radiatively unstable wind-wind bow shock; as the two stars separate the bow shock is re-established and emerges from the thick stellar wind of \\ec-A and the X-rays brighten as the minimum state ends, and the circumstellar material is flooded by UV photons from the hot companion star.  \n",
      "\n",
      "There are four key observational questions which can only be addressed through \\swift\\ monitoring: 1) Is the 2014 X-ray minimum shorter or longer than the 2009 minimum? 2) Is the correlation between X-ray and He II 4686 emission seen in 2009 (Teodoro et al. 2012) confirmed in 2014? 3) Is there a change in the X-ray flare frequency in 2014 compared to previous cycles? 4) Does the overall brightness of the X-ray emission continue to decline after periastron passage? X-ray monitoring observations by \\swift, compared to the monitoring observations by \\rxte\\ and simultaneous/contemporaneous observations in other wavebands, will directly answer all these questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The flexible scheduling capability of \\swift, along with \\swift's sensitivity in the $2-10$ keV band, make it the only instrument able to monitor the X-ray spectrum on relevant (day-week) timescales.  This is critical for interpreting approved, coordinated ground and HST/space based observations, and to monitor what are possibly large-scale changes in the system wind.  \n",
      "\n",
      "%One of the primary goals of these X-ray observations of \\ec\\ is to monitor, on a physically-significant timescale, the response of the shocked X-ray emitting gas in the wind-wind collision region as the stars move in orbit for comparison with  previous orbital cycles. This monitoring is especially crucial near X-ray minimum (which starts about 1 month before periastron passage), when the geometry and thermodynamic state of the shocked gas undergoes extreme changes on short (days-weeks) timescales as the X-ray emitting gas is buried near the dense inner wind of \\ec-A.  Continued X-ray monitoring is especially important for the upcoming X-ray minimum given the surprisingly abrupt recovery from the X-ray minimum observed in the 2009 periastron passage.  Column densities, temperatures and emission measures directly obtainable from the XRT X-ray spectrA are key indicators of the physical changes in mass loss.  This spectral information also serves as the key input to sophisticated 3-D hydro models which have been developed over the past few years (Okazaki et al. 2008; Parkin et al. 2011; Russell 2013).  \n",

During the faint interval of the X-ray minimum, the XRT spectra will be sufficient to measure the X-ray flux to determine the time of the start of the deep X-ray minimum, the deep-to-shallow minimum transition, and the end of the shallow minimum to the X-ray recovery. We note that we will obtain high S/N X-ray spectra during the X-ray minimum from our approved \\chandra\\ ACIS program. As an aid to other observers we will update our \\ec\\ X-ray lightcurve page\\footnote{http://asd.gsfc.nasa.gov/Michael.Corcoran/eta\\_car/etacar\\_rxte\\_lightcurve/index.html} as new data are available.\n",

This information is required to constrain numerical models which include time-dependent mass loss (Russell 2013, Madura et al. 2013).
